# Elm development
This is a simple `make` and `Docker`-based development environment for playing with [#Elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/). The image is based on [node:5-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)

To build your own copy of the image, simply:
```bash
	make build
```

To bring up a REPL:
```bash
	make build repl
```
Simples!
